/* prompt: A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome

//// need to be able to test if a given number is a palindrome
//// then we can simply iterate over the possible pairs of 3-digit numbers
//// brute-force would have us test every possible 3 digit number against 100
//// and then iterate to 101 and test every possible 3 digit number against that
//// but this duplicates work because we'd be testing 100 * 101 AND 101 * 100
//// so instead iterate from 100 to 999 and test it against every number greater or equal
//// test for palindrome status by comparing first/last, then second/second-to-last, etc.
//// when we get to the middle we'll either have a single digit, which needs no test
// //or we'll find ourselves with two numbers, which do need a test
//// we can account for these by simply determining if there are even or odd # of digits
