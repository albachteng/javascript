// The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?

// probably want to start at the halfway point and iterate downward, since the largest possible factor will be half the number
// can use the modulo operator to determine if a number is a factor
// but then comes the difficulty of determining if the number is prime...
